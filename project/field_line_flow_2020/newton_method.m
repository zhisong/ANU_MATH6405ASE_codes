% qpgues - initial guess
% k      - the standard map parameter
% m,n    - rotation number m/n
% abserr - target absolute error
% niter  - the maximum number of iterations
% Outputs
% qp     - the solution
% qphis  - the history of solution
% issuccess - if successfully find the solution (1) or not (0)
% jac - jacobian
